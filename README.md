Calculator
==========

This is simply a basic four function calculator.

The calculator is built on top of an HTML table, the behaviour coded in javascript and the styling done in CSS.

There are still a few features that are needed such as a clear button and many bugs that still need to be documented.

Though my first step is to simply get onto git.
